When putting in arguments for input directories and output directories,
you can just put the name of directory instead of the file path. However,
make sure that the folders are in the same directory as the program
file (e.g. C:\Users\laxpl\Desktop\Backup\cs476\project) where index.py,
inputdir and outputdir all are. Make sure stoplist.txt is in the same
folder as well.
